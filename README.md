**Coffee Fermentation Monitoring & Control App**
<br>
A mobile application developed with Flutter for real-time monitoring and control of the coffee fermentation process. The app enables users to track key environmental parameters—temperature, humidity, and pH levels—while providing control over the ESP32-based fermentation hardware for automated on/off operation. Users can also customize and save flavor profiles directly from the app to guide the fermentation process based on desired taste outcomes.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time monitoring of temperature, humidity, and pH data.
- Automatic and manual control of fermentation devices via ESP32.
- Integration with MQTT (Mosquitto) for efficient IoT communication.
- Data visualization using InfluxDB and Grafana dashboards.
- Profile management feature for personalized flavor fermentation.
- Backend communication through a PHP REST API and MySQL database.
